  title: AD353XR HDL project
  description: "The AD3530R/ AD3530 and AD3531R/ AD3531 are low power, 16-bit, buffered\
    \ voltage output, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) that include a gain bit\
    \ field, resulting in a full-scale output of 2.5 V (gain = 1) or 5 V (gain = 2)\
    \ for a reference voltage of 2.5 V. AD3530/AD3530R has 8 channels, and AD3531/AD3531R\
    \ has 4 channels. AD3530R and AD3531R has an on-chip, buffered, 2.5 V reference\
    \ available at the VREF pin, capable of sourcing external loads up to +5 mA.\n\
    Each DAC channel has its own Input register and DAC register. The DAC Register\
    \ stores digital code equivalent to the DAC output voltage while the Input Register\
    \ acts as a temporary staging register before being passed on the DAC Register.\
    \ With the LDAC function, one or more DAC registers could be updated in parallel\
    \ with the data held in the Input Register. The DAC registers can also be directly\
    \ written to, in which the corresponding output updates immediately without an\
    \ LDAC. \nAD3530R/ AD3530 contains eight buffered voltage output DAC channels\
    \ capable of sourcing 50 mA and sinking up to 40 mA of current. AD3531R/ AD3531\
    \ contains four buffered voltage output DAC channels capable of sourcing 100 mA\
    \ and sinking 80 mA of current.\nThe AD3530R/ AD3530 contains a 27:1 multiplexer\
    \ while AD3531R/ AD3531 contains a 15:1 multiplexer, in which both could output\
    \ a voltage on the MUX_OUT pin that is a representative of either the output voltage\
    \ or output current of a chosen channel, or the internal die temperature of the\
    \ device.\nApplications:\n- Optical transceivers\n- Test and measurement\n- Industrial\
    \ automation\n- Data acquisition systems\nIt targets the AMD Xilinx ZED.\n"
